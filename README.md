# Philips Hue Controller (Work in progress)

Note: This project is a work in progress!

Documentation used:
https://developers.meethue.com/develop/get-started-2/

This javascript program talks to the Philipe Hue API in my house using Node.js. I intend to add all functionality to the program like dimming lights, changing colours, creating groups, and changing scenes.

Currently the project is written in native javascript but I intend to rework the entire UI into React.js
